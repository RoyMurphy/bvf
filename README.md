# Bitcoin Video File

BVF is a Lossless Video Codec designed for maximum file size reduction for on-chain video streaming.

Bitcoin Video File is a highly optimized fork of the latest FFMPEG cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. The target scripts are optimized for maximum lossless audio and video conversion to pre-process and compress all video and audio streams into the most efficient package. These use the very latest libaom, Opus, and M3U8 libraries and AV1 compression algorithms.

## How to use the BVF codec

Use the above BVF script to optimize your videos. Edit the reference and output files to your filename and desired path. Retain the final .webm file type to output the optimized BVF codecs. Either use the standalone script above and use your own FFMPEG build of choice, or download the official build which also contains the latest BVF scripts.
